USE SIGNET NETWORK FOR THIS FINAL TASK 
See README.md file on how to send bitcoin cli commands to the Signet network

For the final task you will first create a bitcoin wallet using your github username as wallet name
After successful creation, add your wallet name to the `wallet.txt` file

Hence, you should add your wallet name to subsquent commands, for example 
`bitcoin-cli -signet -rpcwallet=github-username getblockcount`

You dont need to add your bitcoin-cli commands in this file.
The goal is to update the `xxx.txt` files with the address, transaction and block hashes.

1. Create a bitcoin wallet using your github username as wallet name
    - add your wallet name to the `wallet.txt` file

2. Create a native SegWit address
    - add your address to the `address.txt` file

3. Fund the address from this faucet (alt.signetfaucet.com) and save to files:
   - transaction-1.txt (txid)
   - block-1.txt (blockhash for the transaction)
   - coinbase-1.txt (coinbase transaction in the block)

4. Spend from funded address above:
   - Create transaction with details below:
   - Send exactly 10,000 sats to tb1qddpcyus3u603n63lk7m5epjllgexc24vj5ltp7
   - Fee: 500 sats
   - Make sure transaction fee can be later updated to a higher fee
   - Broadcast transaction
   - Save txid to transaction-2.txt
   - Save transaction block hash to block-2.txt and coinbase transaction to coinbase-2.txt

5. Create 2-of-3 multisig address:
   - save to multisig-address.txt
   - Save redeemScript to multisig-redeem.txt
   - Fund from faucet, and save txid to multisig-transaction.txt
   - Save transaction block hash to multisig-block.txt and coinbase transaction to multisig-coinbase.txt

 STUCK HERE BECAUSE I CAN'T IMPORT THE MULTISIG ADDRESS AND SPEND FROM IT 
6. Spend from multisig:
   - Send exactly 25,000 sats to [MISSING_ADDRESS]
   - Fee: 900 sats
   - Requires 2 signatures
   - Save txid to transaction-3.txt
   - Save confirmation details to block-3.txt and coinbase-3.txt
